Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are

Security vulnerabilities are only considered important if they are present in
the utility in the way it is made available to end users. Specifically, the
utility is made available through a rolling release model: as soon as updates
are considered ready for end-user consumption, they are made available to users
and it is assumed that users are using the latest release of the software.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

<!--
Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
-->

To report a security vulnerability, please follow the instructions at https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability.
